need to revisit how I did modulo for neighbors on commodore 64

see my discussion of modulo for C64 with the Collatz algorithm

started using CBM prg Studio 

It makes sharing code and creating human readable .bas files and
prg files much easier.

previously I had just used vice to create the programs and 
although it was a very authentic retro experience using the original
C64 BASIC editor to create programs, it really gets to be a pain when
coding more than 20 lines.
